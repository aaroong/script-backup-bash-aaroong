## ðŸ“‚ Output Example

If you run the script and try to archive the compressed file into a directory that doesn't exist, the result would be something like:

Type your name: aaron  
Type which directory you want to backup: /home/aaroong/Descargas  
Type where you want the backup to be archived: /home/aaroong/script-bash  
The selected directory doesn't exist.  
Would you want to create this directory? [y/n]  
The directory has been succesfully created.  

Compressing the files...  

The backup has finished.  
Backup disk usage is 112M.  
You have backed up 29 files.  
You have backed up 3 directories.
